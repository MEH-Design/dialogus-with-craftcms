Vagrant LAMP with Craft CMS and Grunt
=====================================
Based on [mattandersen/vagrant-lamp](https://github.com/mattandersen/vagrant-lamp).

This project provides a LAMP stack with Craft CMS installed. You can use this to develop for Craft CMS with version control, or just test something locally without having to worry about setting up a LAMP installation for Craft.

This setup is based on instead of ignoring /craft/app and /craft/storage (those two don't contain any files developers can change), they are on the vagrant machine, but not synced with the repo.
This makes for a much cleaner install, and provides just the directories you need for developing, and nothing more!

Requirements
------------
* [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.com)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

Getting Started
---------------

### Simple Setup
If you want to use this project for developing locally, testing things out or anything else that doesn't include version control, just `git clone` this repository and run `vagrant up` in its folder.

### Advanced Setup
To use this project as a starting point for your next Craft CMS project using a Github repository you have to run the following lines in your console.

    $ git clone https://github.com/MiniXC/vagrant-lamp-craft
    $ cd vagrant-lamp-craft
    $ chmod +x hooks/*
    $ cp hooks/* .git/hooks
    $ vagrant up

This will dump your database to a file and add it to git whenever you commit. The database will be restored from this file `post-merge`, meaning whenever you download from your repository.

### Accessing your Server
Add `192.168.42.42 craft.dev` to your `/etc/hosts` file to access your server on your host machine, just by pointing you browser to `craft.dev`.

### Changing default Values
If you want to change a variable, make sure to do so in all the right places of this project.

| Variable       | Default Value |                               Files                       |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guest IP       | 192.168.42.42 | `Vagrantfile` `/etc/hosts`                                |
| Database Name  | craft         | `provision.sh` `/scripts/pre-commit` `scripts/post-merge` |
| MySQL Password | root          | `provision.sh` `/scripts/pre-commit` `scripts/post-merge` |

### Manually dumping/restoring the Database
Do this with `vagrant ssh` on the server. Run `scripts/mysql-dump.sh` with two parameters (database and mysql password) to dump the database to `mysql/dump.sql` on your host. Do the same with `scripts/mysql-restore.sh` to resore the database from this file.
